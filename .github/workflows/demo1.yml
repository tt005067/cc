# on: [push, workflow_dispatch] : passing multipple events
# activity type
# passing activity type to and event if available! :
# on:
# pull_request:
#  types: [opened,closed] or above
# the next event must be at the same position as the first one  workflow_dispatch:

# activity filters
# ex :on.push.<branches|tags|branches-ignore|tags-ignore>
# = 'dev-*' all dev branches start with dev-
# 'feat/**'
# we can do also based on the path (if it's available for that event )ex: igoner the path to just in the specifi path

# important :  By default, Pull Requests based on Forks do NOT trigger a workflow
# Reason: Everyone can fork & open pull requests Malicious workflow runs & excess cost could be caused
# so First-time contributors must be approved manually
# cancelling : By default, Workflows get cancelled if Jobs fail
# By default, a Job fails if a least one Step fails
# You can also cancel workflows manually
# Skipping : BIJ default, all matching events start a workflow
# we can use skip when we add some changesin our code when we know it does not have any effect on code or maybe it's a comment
# to skip when we commit we need to put one these thins in the commit message
#[skip ci] [ci skip] [no ci] [skip actions] [actions skip]
